#  Tools
For the tasks in this internship, we primarily use Python, a versatile programming language known for its data Science capabilities. Here's how Python is used in this internship:

- Data Cleaning: Python is used to clean and preprocess the data, which includes handling null values and outliers.

- Summary Statistics: Python is utilized to calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.  

- Data Distribution: Python is use to see the data distribution of dataset by usging hostogram/bar charts.

- Duplicate Values: Python is also use to deal with duplicates values in dataset.

# Tasks

## Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
In this task,we perform build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The key libraries used for this task are:

- numpy
- pandas   
- matplotlib.pyplot   
- seaborn   
- sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder   
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split   
- sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression

## Task 3: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
For this task, our goal is to calculate essential summary statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation. The primary libraries used in this task are:

- numpy
- pandas   
- matplotlib.pyplot   
- seaborn   
- sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder   
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split   
- sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression

## Task 3: Visualization using Histogram
For this task, we see data distribution using histogram/bar charts in datset. The key libraries used for this task are:

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- IO: For handling input and output.
- Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization.

## Task 4: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
For this task, our goal is to identify and remove duplicate values in datset. The key libraries used for this task are:

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn.cluster.KMeans
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn

# Key Insights
Throughout the internship, you'll encounter some key insights, including:

-  Dealing with Null Values: You will learn how to handle 10% of null values in the dataset, which can be done by either removing columns or rows or replacing them with the median.
- Handling Outliers: As part of the process, you will address 15 outliers in the dataset, improving data quality.
- Explore Data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.
